#Movie Trailer website submission

In my first submission I decided to add a little bit more to what I was asked.

I decided to use [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch the most popular movies and shows through their RESTful API, and display their information and trailer.

I also made a few adjustments to the UI.

The code is of my own writting, the [little-popcorn](https://popcorntime.sh/images/logo-valentines.png) picture was taken from the popcorn time website.

Version of python used: *3.5.2*

To use, simply run main.py.
 
 Like so: 
 
 `python3 main.py`

**No 3rd party modules used**
